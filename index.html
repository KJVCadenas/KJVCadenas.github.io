<h1>WEBPROG Introductions</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Why Yes?<ins> I am fond with computers ever since I was a kid. I was the one in my family<br>
		that they depended on when it comes to computer related problems, and it became an<br>
		inspiration for me since I was able to help someone with the skills that I learned.</ins></li>
	<li>I.T. Experience: <ins>Back then, my family is not at all knowledgeable about internet or other technical<br>
		stuff, but we had a standard cable connection wherein it is connected to our personal computer to<br>
		connect to the internet. My family wanted to have Wi-Fi, but the monthly plans that had a Wi-Fi<br>
		router back then was expensive for us. It was me who thought of buying a cheap router from<br>
		CDR-King and configuring it to have a usable Wi-Fi without availing a pricy monthly fee.</ins></li>
	<li>Hobbies: <ins>First Person Shooter and Gacha games</ins></li>
	<li>Goals in life: <ins>To have a job that I like with good pay in order to give back to my parents.</ins></li>
	<li>Learning Expectations: <ins>I hope I can learn how to efficiently program websites and design it.</ins></li>
	<li>What do you want to learn?: <ins>I want to learn all about the things that is needed when creating<br>
		an application or a website. I want to learn how to implement databases and create GUI.</ins></li>
